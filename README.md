# Google-Stock-Price-Prediction_using-RNN
This project is done by me where I used the rnn model . I prefer lstm(long short term memory) version of rnn beacuse of its long term memory handling capability . From 2012-2016 all the google stock price data are being used . It's been a great pleasure as you are reading this . Hope you would like to see my other work .
